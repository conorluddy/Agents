# Claude Code Agents

A repository for managing specialized Claude Code agent configurations that extend Claude's capabilities for specific development workflows.

## What are Claude Code Agents?

Claude Code agents are specialized configurations that customize Claude's behavior for specific development scenarios. Each agent includes:

- **Custom system prompts** tailored for specific tasks
- **Model specifications** (e.g., Opus for complex reasoning)
- **Usage examples** and context patterns
- **UI customization** (colors, descriptions)

## Available Agents

### ðŸ§  Feature Brainstormer
Strategic product evolution and lateral thinking for identifying feature opportunities within existing codebases.

### ðŸ“Š Repo Analyzer  
Comprehensive codebase analysis and documentation, perfect for understanding unfamiliar repositories or updating project documentation.

### ðŸ“± Swift Issue Resolver
iOS/Swift development specialist that takes full ownership of GitHub issues, from analysis through PR creation.

## Quick Start

### Sync Your Agents
```bash
./sync-agents.sh
```

This script automatically:
- Copies agent files from `~/.claude/agents/` 
- Commits changes to the repository
- Pushes updates to GitHub

### Manual Setup
If you need to make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x sync-agents.sh
```

## Agent Development

Want to create a new agent? Follow the standard format:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Clear description with usage examples
model: opus
color: red|purple|green
---

Your custom system prompt goes here...
```

Edit files in your local `~/.claude/agents/` directory, then sync with the script.
